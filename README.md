Lidar Viewer as Virtual Top-down View (2.5D)
==========================================

This project is to visualize LiDAR data as a 2D image (virtual top-down view) with the ability to zoom in/out and pan. 

The application reads XYZ or XYZC file (in which X,Y,Z is 3D coordinates and C is color) and visualize the results in the form of 2.5D image. It offers zoom and pan functionality.

The program was developed using MS Visual Studio .NET 2003 using the CImage class for presenting image.

The application screen is presented below.
